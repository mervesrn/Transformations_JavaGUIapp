# Transformations_JavaGUIapp

In this labwork, I writed a GUI application using AWT. 

You are expected to;
• Have a colored background of your liking. I have used Color.getHSBColor(0.8f, 0.2f, 0.9f).<br>
• Two lines that divide the frame into 4 equal parts, that are x and y axes.<br>
• A triangle that is filled with a color. (You can use fillPolygon() function)<br>
• Add a control panel.<br>
• Add 6 buttons to the panel called “Translate Up”, “Translate Down”,“Translate Right”, “Translate Left”, “Reflect X”<br>
• Menubar of this program should have an item called “Set Default”which will reset the values of x and y to the values they had initially.<br>
• Modify the action listener according to the buttons and menu item.<br>
• Set the title to “Transformations” in the constructor and add your WindowListener.<br>
• Modify your paint method to draw 1 triangle and 2 lines with different colors.<br>
• The main method should create and display an instance of Transformations().<br>
• The frame should be set to the size 800 by 800.<br>
• You can use a grid layout which is pretty straightforward.<br>
• Submit only one file called Transformations.java.<br>
